	// Index holds the index of the log entry.
	Index uint64

	// Term holds the election term of the log entry.

	// Extensions holds an opaque byte slice of information for middleware. It
	// is up to the client of the library to properly modify this as it adds
	// layers and remove those layers when appropriate. This value is a part of
	// the log, so very large values could cause timing issues.
	//
	// N.B. It is _up to the client_ to handle upgrade paths. For instance if
	// using this with go-raftchunking, the client should ensure that all Raft
	// peers are using a version that can handle that extension before ever
	// actually triggering chunking behavior. It is sometimes sufficient to
	// ensure that non-leaders are upgraded first, then the current leader is
	// upgraded, but a leader changeover during this process could lead to
	// trouble, so gating extension behavior via some flag in the client
	// program is also a good idea.
	Extensions []byte

	// AppendedAt stores the time the leader first appended this log to it's
	// LogStore. Followers will observe the leader's time. It is not used for
	// coordination or as part of the replication protocol at all. It exists only
	// to provide operational information for example how many seconds worth of
	// logs are present on the leader which might impact follower's ability to
	// catch up after restoring a large snapshot. We should never rely on this
	// being in the past when appending on a follower or reading a log back since
	// the clock skew can mean a follower could see a log with a future timestamp.
	// In general too the leader is not required to persist the log before
	// delivering to followers although the current implementation happens to do
	// this.
